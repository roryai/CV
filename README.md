### INTRO

I am a junior software developer who has just finished an intensive 16 week software development course at Makers Academy.

I have worked for myself for the last three years running an estate agency that I founded. I changed careers to learn to code so that I can bring my ideas to life and make a positive change in the world.

My final project at Makers Academy was CSS Playground, a single page app that allows you to generate CSS and HTML without writing any code.

### SKILLS AND STRENGTHS

*Determined*
I have changed the direction of my life in order to become a software developer, deciding not to grow a profitable business in order to learn a creative and technical skill. Determination saw me through learning my first language in the months I spent learning solo before deciding to come to Makers Academy.

*Curious and inquisitive*
I always want to know both how and why things work the way they do. This allows me to dig deep into the concepts behind the languages and frameworks that I use. My methodical learning style has resulted in a solid foundation of knowledge and good code sense that means that I am able to explain why things work when I encounter them in unfamiliar circumstances, or to combine things I already know in ways I haven't previously encountered.

*Empathic*
I care about people and understanding them. Excellent people skills are vital to understanding and managing a client's needs, and allow for productive work environments.

My peers at Makers Academy listed my qualities in an anonymised feedback session: ‘inquisitive', 'asks great questions', ‘committed', 'dedicates time to learning', 'good listener' and ‘patient'.

### THE COURSE - WHAT I LEARNED AND ENJOYED

Makers Academy is a fast-paced environment where you are constantly learning new concepts and languages. In our fourth week we built a website with a database that stored bookmarks. I had never created a database before, and by the end of the week we had implemented a web interface with a database that stored user emails and passwords.

In the next week we switched to javaScript, which was a somewhat jarring experience after spending so long with Ruby. After an uncomfortable few hours I found my feet again and by the time I had finished week 7 I had come to have a much greater appreciation for javaScript, and found myself enjoying writing with it.

The following we used Rails, the feel of which is in stark contrast to a single page javaScript app. It was a valuable insight into a powerful framework that values convention over configuration.

We had four project weeks during the course which taught us how to embrace the power of working as a group and also how to overcome the challenges you face. For our final project we used React, which has a steep learning curve and requires you to think in a way that feels counter intuitive at first. Our first week was hard, but by the start of our second week we were able to be very productive and succeeded at what we had set out to do.

I have learned lots of high level skills and behaviours at Makers Academy, the foremost of which is learning how to learn. I now embrace the initial discomfort of unfamiliar territory, and have strategies for educating myself when I am stuck.
