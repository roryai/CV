### Rory Aitchison - CV

I am a junior software developer who has just finished an intensive 16 week software development course at Makers Academy.

I have worked for myself for the last three years running an estate agency that I founded. I changed careers to learn to code so that I can bring my ideas to life and make a positive change in the world.

**Tech Skills: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Jasmine, HTML and CSS**

| [CSS Playground](https://github.com/roryai/CSS-playground) | A single page app that allows you to generate CSS and HTML without writing any code. A user can create divs and set their colour, border style, border width, position etc. Images and links can be inserted. The CSS and HTML updates in real time on the screen so that users can see the effect of the changes they make. CSS and HTML can then be downloaded with a click of a button. You can try it [here](https://css-play.herokuapp.com) | React |
| [Note App](https://github.com/roryai/note-app) | This is an exercise in pure javaScript and demonstrates my object oriented code skills. The result is a simple single page web app that allows a user to write a note, then view that note on the page by clicking on a link consisting of the first 20 characters of the note. | javaScript |



### Skills and Strengths

My peers at Makers Academy listed my qualities in an anonymised feedback session: ‘inquisitive', 'asks great questions', ‘committed', 'dedicates time to learning', 'good listener' and ‘patient'.

**Determined**

I have changed the direction of my life in order to become a software developer, deciding to learn a creative and technical skill instead of growing a profitable business. Determination saw me through learning my first language in the months I spent learning solo before deciding to come to Makers Academy.

**Curious and inquisitive**

I always want to know both how and why things work the way they do. This allows me to dig deep into the concepts behind the languages and frameworks that I use. My methodical learning style has resulted in a solid foundation of knowledge and good code sense that means that I am able to explain why things work when I encounter them in unfamiliar circumstances, or to combine things I already know in ways I haven't previously encountered.

**Empathic**

I care about people and understanding them. Excellent people skills are vital to understanding and managing a client's needs, and allow for productive work environments.

### Makers Academy

Makers Academy is an intense and fast-paced environment where you are constantly learning new concepts and languages. We spent the first 4 weeks learning good object oriented design principles, and during the final 8 weeks we learned about various aspects of the web and web app development in pairs and groups. For example:

Week 4: built a website that stored bookmarks, implemented a database and encrypted user login.

Week 7: created a single page note taking app using pure javaScript.

Week 8: Rails week. We made a yelp clone from the ground up. Fascinating experiencing the difference between pure javaScript and a framework that takes care of a lot of code in the background.

We had four project weeks during the course which taught us how to embrace the power of working as a group and also how to overcome the challenges you face. Experiencing pairing and group work has given me a valuable insight into different working styles.

I have learned lots of high level skills and behaviours at Makers Academy, the foremost of which is learning how to learn. I now embrace the initial discomfort of unfamiliar territory, and have strategies for educating myself when I am stuck.
