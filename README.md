| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [photo_transfer](https://github.com/roryai/photo_transfer) | My current project, a program that takes the photos from my camera and transfers them to my hard drive. An exercise in using Ruby to manipulate my file system. Current functionality is to create folders according to the date the photo was taken (taken from the EXIF data) and sort the photos into the appropriate dated folder. Next steps are ensuring files aren't copied, managing error handling etc. | Ruby |
| [CSS Playground](https://github.com/roryai/CSS-playground) | A single page app that allows you to generate CSS and HTML without writing any code. A user can create divs and set their colour, border style, border width, position etc. Images and links can be inserted. The CSS and HTML updates in real time on the screen so that users can see the effect of the changes they make. CSS and HTML can then be downloaded with a click of a button. You can try it [here](https://css-play.herokuapp.com) | React |
| [Note App](https://github.com/roryai/note-app) | This is an exercise in pure javaScript and demonstrates my object oriented code skills. The result is a simple single page web app that allows a user to write a note, then view that note on the page by clicking on a link consisting of the first 20 characters of the note. | javaScript |



### Skills and Strengths

My peers at Makers Academy listed my qualities in an anonymised feedback session: ‘inquisitive', 'asks great questions', ‘committed', 'dedicates time to learning', 'good listener' and ‘patient'.

**Determined**

I have changed the direction of my life in order to become a software developer, deciding to learn a creative and technical skill instead of growing a profitable business. Determination saw me through learning my first language in the months I spent learning solo before deciding to come to Makers Academy.

**Curious and inquisitive**

My boundless curiosity drives me to learn both how and why things work the way they do, and how they are connected to other things. I am always asking questions, and love the process of learning. Combined with strong abstract thinking, this gives me excellent problem solving skills and ability to acquire new knowledge.

**Empathic**

I care about people and understanding them. I believe strongly in a people-focused approach to work and the work environment. Excellent people skills are vital to understanding and managing a client's needs, and contribute towards productive work environments.

### Makers Academy

Makers Academy is an intense and fast-paced environment where you are constantly learning new concepts and languages. We pair-programmed every day, which was an excellent way to learn and share knowledge. We spent the first 4 weeks learning solid object oriented design principles, and during the final 8 weeks we learned about various aspects of the web and web app development in pairs and groups. For example:

Week 4: built a website that stored bookmarks, implemented a database and encrypted user login.

Week 7: created a single page note taking app using pure javaScript.

Week 8: Rails week. We made a yelp clone from the ground up. Fascinating experiencing the difference between pure javaScript and a framework that abstracts the configuration away.

We had four project weeks during the course which taught us how to embrace the power of working as a group and also how to overcome the challenges you face. Experiencing pairing and group work has given me a valuable insight into different working styles.

I have learned lots of high level skills and behaviours at Makers Academy, the foremost of which is learning how to learn. I now embrace the initial discomfort of unfamiliar territory, and have strategies for educating myself when I am stuck.
